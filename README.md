Infomation about the dataset is available here on https://www.kaggle.com/sudarshanpatil/car-price-regression If you download/

# Updated
Scraped data of used Audi cars listings. I collected  the data to make a tool to predict how to sell his old car for compared to other stuff on the market, and then just extended the data set. Then made a more general car value regression model.

In future i will like to concat more datas of cars to optimize the performance 


# Content
The cleaned data set contains information of price, transmission, mileage, fuel type, road tax, miles per gallon (mpg), and engine size. I've removed duplicate listings and cleaned the columns, but have included a notebook showing the process and the original data for anyone who wants to check/improve my work.

# Inspiration
It'd be cool to have some insights and visualisations of the data. Also, am open to ideas on how to expand the data set.
